   <p>In my 11th std i chose course was computer science. I think Myself I wanna good programmer and I join big company and easy to learn coding etc..,but i learn 
    some basic computer knowledge and how is it work and how to handle systems etc..,Its learn my first volume book... After gives second volume book enter into
    the first coding in c++....first time learn it some confusing codes.I saw a book newly... what was that it's damn coding. I learn lot codes and theroy
    in c++ like variable,functions,OOPS concepts,constructor,array etc.., Learn some codes understood and misunderstood those times.Finally comes
    main exam...I learn codes theory,syntax,example giving hard work for the main examinations After Result I scored in exam 73 out of 100.i'm Glad.</p>
 
    <p>In my 12th std started happily because i think i know lot ofcodes but god twist in my life again fresh mind in python programming it book page more than
    300 pages.I really shocked how to learn this codes but its very easily understood and less coding but one think thats book tree,sort,search codes was very
    confusing what hell is that damn coding.. I hate myself same concept but different way to understood little bit changes 
    I believe myself learn book line by line fully memorized.finally go for an main exam fully easy Questions I happy to end now its result was 94 out of 100.</p>

    <p>Most critical situation in my life which degree you will choose change your carrer path . I choose Bsc computer science in worst college experience 
      because no placement,no iv and etc..,Unfortunately my batch start with covid-19 causes 1 year all pass 2 year 3rd semester all pass 
      4th semester is original talent faced but previous semester most important subject missed C , C++ , JAVA but i learn online classes and
      growth throw the online websites to gain 45% knowledge of previous languages. others complete gain basic knowledge from college good..
